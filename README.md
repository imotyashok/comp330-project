# COMP 330 Project: Stage 1

Running main will call the main function in xmlparser if put in testing mode. In this mode, the questions will be written to the command line and answers 
The xml-parser places questions into a dictionary which has the questions as keys and the answers as values. To answer, the exact answer must be copied, but it is not
case sensitive. Thus, the answers 'b. answer', 'B. ANSWEr' and 'B. Answer' are all identical.

## Running the program 
To run, simply use the command ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py``` depending on your system. You might get an error saying that __'lxml'__ is not found; if this is the case, then you must install the __lxml__ package. You can do this by using the command ```pip install lxml```.
